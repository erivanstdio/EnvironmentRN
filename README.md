I choosed to start a new project with bare [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) using fabric in order to use the latest features from [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev).

Here are some good links:
[React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) - **set up** before forking this repo;
[React Native Website](https://reactnative.dev) - learn more about React Native;
[Getting Started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) - an **overview** of React Native and how setup your environment;
[Learn the Basics](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) - a **guided tour** of the React Native **basics**;
[Blog](https://reactnative.dev/blog) - read the latest official React Native **Blog** posts;
[`@facebook/react-native`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) - the Open Source; GitHub **repository** for React Native.

Basically, 

Android:
```bash
yarn
yarn start  
yarn android
```

iOS:
```bash
yarn
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
yarn start  
yarn android
```

Or run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
